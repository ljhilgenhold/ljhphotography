         <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Hello, I'm Lara Hilgenhold! Photography has been my passion since I was about thirteen. It all started with one middle school class where I fell in love with the art of photography. I continued with photography classes all throughout high school, where I continued to grow as a photographer. After graduation, I started doing "first 48" newborn photography where I photographed newborns and their families during the baby's first few days. This is where I discovered that newborn and family portraits hold a special place in my heart. Nothing is more heartwarming than getting to capturing those special moments knowing that they'll be cherished for years to come!</p>
