    <p>Hi, my name is Lara Hilgenhold! I found my love for photography during my final year of middle school when I decided to take a photography course as one of my classes. Little did I know that signing up for that class would unlock a passion so deep I decided I absolutely had to pursue it as a career!</p>

            <p>After my photography awaking in middle school, I continued to take photography courses through all my years of high school. After graduation, I went on to do in-hospital "Fresh 48" newborn photos until the pandemic started and brought that to an end. I also have done some school portraits in the past where I learned that the client experience during the session is  just as important as the final images. Although I have 10 years of experience, I believe that one never stops learning and I believe that is one of reasons my photography continues to grow today!</p>

            <p>As a growing photographer, I am currently exploring all types of photography! I have done newborns, couples, solo portraits, and have also dabbled in events, weddings, and sports. My personal goal is to be able to replace my regular job with my own photography business. They always say "you'll never work a day in your life if you do what you love", so I guess my goal is to never work again!</p>
