                    <p> The Client may cancel or reschedule up to 3 days before the session without penalty, except for the non-refundable deposit. If Photographer must cancel, all money paid by Client will be refunded, including the deposit.</p>

                    <p>
                        - If there is a 50% chance or higher of rain forecasted for the date and time of the photo session, the photographer will reach out to see if the client would like to reschedule or proceed. 
                        <br><br>
                        - If the photoshoot is scheduled at or before 12pm, the photographer will reach out by 6pm the day before to see what the client would like to do. If the photoshoot is after 12pm, the photographer will reach out by 9am day-of to see what the client would like to do.
                        <br><br>
                        - If the photographer does not hear back from the client within 1 hour before the photoshoot is scheduled to take place, the photographer will assume the client WILL NOT be proceeding with the photoshoot. 
                        <br><br>
                        - In this case, the client would be eligible for a refund of the fees applicable to the photoshoot, not including the non-refundable deposit OR they may reschedule their photoshoot for a future available date and the deposit will carry over to that future date.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">When should I schedule my newborn's session?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You should schedule your newborn photoshoot around your baby's due date. Once your baby arrives, we can solidify a date and time. A newborn session must take place between the first 7 - 20 days of your baby's birth.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What do I need to do before my newborn's session?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>It is ideal that baby be fed right before the session so they are more likely to sleep through the photoshoot. You should also have any outfits, blankets, or accessories ready for the session.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What if my baby is born early?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If your baby arrives before your due date, we can try to make arrangements to schedule your photoshoot earlier. If your baby is in the NICU, we will wait until your baby is discharged from the hospital.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

             <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">Do you do in-hospital newborn photography?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes! Capturing those Fresh 48 photos is something I am well-versed in! If you would like Fresh 48 photos, please leave a comment in your Newborn Session inquiry! Fresh 48 sessions must be scheduled BEFORE the baby is born and near the expected due date.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Family portraits are often immediate family or household members only, but if you have other family members you would like to include then we can work it out! Please note that larger groups (8+) can add a little challenge so it is best to keep it to immediate family only.</p>
